# Production Testing Guide

## 1. Build Process
### Command
```bash
pnpm build
```
### Expected Output
- Build files will be generated in the `build` directory
- Verify that the build completes without errors
- Look for "built successfully" message in the output

## 2. Serve Production Build
### Command
```bash
pnpx serve build/client
```
### Important Notes About Serving
- ⚠️ ONLY use `serve` - it's included by default, DO NOT install any additional packages (sirv, http-server, etc.)
- ⚠️ If port 3000 is in use, `serve` will automatically pick another port
- ⚠️ The server will show you the actual URL to use in the terminal output
- ⚠️ Always serve from `build/client` directory, never from root or other directories

### Expected Output
- Server should start successfully
- You should see a message with local and network URLs
- Default URL will be http://localhost:3000

## 3. Open in Browser
The server will show you the exact URL to use. For Windows PowerShell, you can open it with:

```powershell
Start-Process "http://localhost:3000"
```

#### macOS (Terminal)
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```

#### Linux (Terminal)
```bash
xdg-open http://localhost:3000
```

## 4. Testing
Ask the user to verify that the application works correctly in their browser.

## 5. Cleanup
### Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the serve command is running

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ DO NOT install any additional packages for serving - use ONLY the built-in `serve` command
- ⚠️ Always run `pnpm build` before serving
- ⚠️ Always serve from `build/client` directory
- ⚠️ Check the terminal output for the correct port number
- ⚠️ If you see 404 errors for assets, ensure you're serving from the correct directory
- ⚠️ Make sure all environment variables are properly set before building
