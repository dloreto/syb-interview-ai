# Production Testing Guide

## 1. Build Process
### Command
```bash
pnpm build
```
### Expected Output
- Build files will be generated in the `build` directory
- Verify that the build completes without errors
- Look for "built successfully" message in the output

## 2. Serve Production Build
### Command
```bash
pnpx serve build/client
```
### Expected Output
- Server should start successfully
- You should see a message with local and network URLs
- Default URL will be http://localhost:3000

## 3. Open in Browser
### OS-Specific Commands
Choose the appropriate command based on your operating system:

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Start-Process "http://localhost:3000"
```

#### macOS (Terminal)
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```

#### Linux (Terminal)
```bash
xdg-open http://localhost:3000
```

## 4. Testing
Ask the user to verify that the application works correctly in their browser.

## 5. Cleanup
### Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the serve command is running

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ Always complete the full testing process before deployment
- ⚠️ Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- ⚠️ The build process must complete successfully before serving
- ⚠️ Get explicit confirmation from the user about successful testing
- ⚠️ Test on multiple browsers if required by project specifications
